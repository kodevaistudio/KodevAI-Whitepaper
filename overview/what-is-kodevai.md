## ðŸ¤– What is KodevAI?

KodevAI is a next-gen no-code app and dApp builder powered by LLM-based AI agents. It allows anyone â€” from solo founders to Web3 creators â€” to build fully functional web and blockchain applications just by describing them in natural language.

At the heart of KodevAI is its Vibe Coding Agent â€” a generative AI that understands your prompts and produces front-end, back-end, and smart contract code in real-time. The platform simplifies everything from deployment to database setup â€” without writing a single line of code manually.

KodevAI is more than a builder; itâ€™s an ecosystem. With token-based access tiers, a prompt marketplace, and upcoming multi-agent extensions, it reimagines how we build and scale in the era of intelligent software.

KodevAI runs on the BNB Chain and offers exclusive feature access through a token-based subscription model powered by $KODEV. Holders and stakers of the token can unlock powerful capabilities like AI agents, one-click deployments, and advanced integrations.

Whether youâ€™re building a startup MVP, an NFT marketplace, a DAO dashboard, or just experimenting â€” KodevAI empowers you to create with unmatched speed and creativity.
