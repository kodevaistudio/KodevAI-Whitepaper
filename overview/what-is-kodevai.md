KodevAI is a next-gen no-code app and dApp builder powered by LLM-based AI agents. It allows anyone â€” from solo founders to Web3 creators â€” to build fully functional web and blockchain applications just by describing them in natural language.

At the heart of KodevAI is its Vibe Coding Agent â€” a generative AI that understands your prompts and produces front-end, back-end, and smart contract code in real-time. The platform simplifies everything from deployment to database setup â€” without writing a single line of code manually.

KodevAI is more than a builder; itâ€™s an ecosystem. With token-based access tiers, a prompt marketplace, and upcoming multi-agent extensions, it reimagines how we build and scale in the era of intelligent software.

# What is KodevAI?

KodevAI is the worldâ€™s first full-stack app/dApp builder powered entirely by AI prompts â€” no code, no drag-and-drop builders, no development teams.

Users simply describe their project in natural language, and KodevAI's Vibe Coding Agent transforms that idea into live, modular, production-ready code. It bridges frontend, backend, smart contracts, and database logic, all within a simple conversational flow.

This platform isn't just a builder â€” itâ€™s a next-gen AI development companion tailored for Web3, enabling creators, founders, developers, and communities to launch powerful apps and dApps faster than ever.

KodevAI runs on the BNB Chain and offers exclusive feature access through a token-based subscription model powered by \$KODEV. Holders and stakers of the token can unlock powerful capabilities like AI agents, one-click deployments, and advanced integrations.
