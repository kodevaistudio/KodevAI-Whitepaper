# 👥 Core Team

KodevAI is crafted by a global crew of builders, dreamers, and technologists reimagining how software is created in the age of AI and decentralization.

## 🚀 Who We Are

We are a cross-functional collective of:

* **AI Engineers** — Specialists in LLMs, prompt design, and agentic workflows
* **Web3 Developers** — Fluent in smart contracts, token mechanics, and decentralized infrastructure
* **No-Code Innovators** — Making technical creation accessible through language-first interfaces
* **Design Thinkers** — Focused on seamless, intuitive UX and beautiful tools
* **Growth Strategists** — Driving ecosystem adoption through community, quests, and storytelling

## 🧬 Founding Beliefs

* **Prompting is Programming** — Natural language is the new dev environment
* **Builders Should Own Their Stack** — Self-hostable, token-gated, on-chain whenever possible
* **No Locked Doors** — Token-based access, not paywalls
* **Community Drives Product** — Our roadmap is shaped by users, not just founders
