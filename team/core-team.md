## 🚀 Who We Are

We are a cross-functional group of:

- **AI Engineers** — Experts in large language models, prompt engineering, and agent architecture.  
- **Web3 Developers** — Focused on seamless on-chain deployments, smart contracts, and token utility.  
- **No-Code Pioneers** — With deep insights into simplifying development for creators and non-engineers.  
- **Design Thinkers** — Dedicated to human-centric interfaces, intuitive UX, and beautiful product design.  
- **Growth Strategists** — Skilled in community building, product-led growth, and ecosystem expansion.

## 🧠 Founding Beliefs

- **Prompting is Programming** — We believe natural language should be the new programming interface.  
- **Open Development** — Builders should own what they create, on and off chain.  
- **Decentralized Access** — Tools shouldn’t be locked behind paywalls. Token-based access aligns incentives.  
- **Community-Driven Innovation** — The best products are shaped by their users, not just their founders.
