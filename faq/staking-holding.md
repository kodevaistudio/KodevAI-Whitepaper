# Staking & Holding $KODEV

Access to KodevAI’s features and rewards is determined by how much $KODEV you **hold** or **stake** in your wallet.

## 💡 Why Hold or Stake?

KodevAI is a **token-gated platform**, meaning your access to features, tiers, and benefits depends on your $KODEV balance. Holding or staking unlocks specific capabilities within the ecosystem.
