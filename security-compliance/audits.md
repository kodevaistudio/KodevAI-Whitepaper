🔐 Smart Contract Audits

Security is foundational at KodevAI. We understand that our platform handles not only code but also user trust, financial transactions, and access control. To ensure the highest standards, we’ve embedded rigorous auditing practices into our development and deployment pipelines.

✅ Pre-Deployment Smart Contract Audits

Before any smart contract is deployed on mainnet, it undergoes the following:
	•	Automated Static Analysis
Tools like MythX, Slither, and Hardhat are used to catch bugs early.
	•	Formal Verification
Critical contracts are mathematically verified to ensure correctness under all edge cases.
	•	Third-Party Audits
We partner with reputable auditing firms to conduct manual reviews and issue audit reports.

🔁 Continuous Auditing Workflow

KodevAI maintains a security-first CI/CD pipeline with:
	•	Regular re-audits when contracts are upgraded.
	•	Strict version control and signed release builds.
	•	Testnet simulations for gas analysis, exploit detection, and stress testing.

📄 Audit Reports

Audit reports will be published and accessible publicly via:
	•	Our GitHub repository
	•	KodevAI Docs (GitBook)
	•	On-chain references via IPFS/Arweave

🛡️ Bug Bounty Program (Coming Soon)

To further strengthen our security posture, we’ll be launching a Bug Bounty Program for community security researchers. Verified bugs will be rewarded in $KODEV.

KodevAI is committed to transparency and security — not as features, but as fundamental principles.
