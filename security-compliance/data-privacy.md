🔐 Data Privacy

At KodevAI, protecting user data isn’t an afterthought — it’s a core value. We follow strict data privacy practices across all our systems to ensure user trust, compliance, and ethical AI development.

📜 Privacy by Design

KodevAI incorporates privacy at every level of product design. Our principles include:\
• Minimal Data Collection\
We only collect what’s necessary for functionality, not for monetization.\
• End-to-End Encryption\
Sensitive user data, credentials, and API keys are encrypted both in transit and at rest.\
• User Control\
Users retain full control over their data. You can export, delete, or opt-out at any time.

🔍 Transparency in AI Interactions

As an AI-first platform, we’re conscious of data exposure risks when interacting with language models. Our safeguards include:\
• Session Isolation\
Prompt sessions are sandboxed to prevent data leaks across users.\
• Prompt Redaction\
Sensitive or identifiable inputs are filtered or anonymized before LLM interactions.\
• On-Device LLM (coming soon)\
Users will be able to use private, local language models for maximum control and privacy.

⸻

🌐 GDPR & Global Compliance

KodevAI is committed to compliance with major data protection laws:\
• GDPR (Europe)\
Right to be forgotten, data access, and transparency are fully supported.\
• CCPA (California)\
Users can opt out of data sharing and view what’s stored about them.\
• DPDP (India) & other emerging privacy standards are tracked and incorporated proactively.

🔧 3rd-Party Service Policies

We use a small number of secure infrastructure tools (e.g., Supabase, Vercel, OpenAI API) and only after verifying:\
• Their compliance certifications (SOC2, ISO27001, etc.)\
• Their own data storage and deletion policies\
• Clear contractual data boundaries

⸻

🤝 User Responsibilities

While we provide a secure environment, users should:\
• Keep private keys, API credentials, and tokens safe\
• Use 2FA for Web3 wallet and platform login\
• Report any suspicious activity to care@kodevai.studio

KodevAI’s data privacy mission is simple: Your data belongs to you.\
We protect it — always.
