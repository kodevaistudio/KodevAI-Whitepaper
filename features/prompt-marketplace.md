# Prompt Marketplace

KodevAI introduces a creator-driven Prompt Marketplace, where users can share, monetize, and discover the best prompts for building apps and dApps. It’s a decentralized hub for creativity, knowledge, and community-powered innovation.

## Key Highlights

* **Monetize Your Prompts**: List your custom prompts and earn $KODEV tokens when others use them.
* **Discover Top Prompts**: Search, filter, and explore the most effective prompts rated by the community.
* **Creator Profiles**: Showcase your best work and build your on-chain reputation as a top prompt engineer.
* **Community Voting**: Let the best prompts rise through community upvotes and usage metrics.
* **Use Across Projects**: Import saved prompts directly into your workspace and launch apps faster.

## Why It Matters

The Prompt Marketplace empowers non-devs and creative minds to contribute to the ecosystem meaningfully. It also boosts reuse, experimentation, and rapid development.

## Coming Soon

* **Token-Gated Prompts**
* **Collab Prompt Packs**
* **Leaderboards & Achievements**

The marketplace is more than a library — it’s an evolving economy of prompts and creativity, owned by the community.
