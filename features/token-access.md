# Token-Gated Access

KodevAI introduces a unique access model powered by $KODEV tokens. Instead of traditional SaaS subscriptions, users unlock features by holding or staking tokens, aligning with the decentralized ethos of Web3.

## ðŸ”“ Unlock Features with $KODEV

Holding $KODEV tokens grants access to different feature tiers, empowering users to build without recurring fees:

* **Free Tier (< 90,000 $KODEV)**: Limited access to KodevAI, ideal for exploration.
* **Builder Tier (â‰¥ 90,000 $KODEV)**: Access to core features like full-stack builds and GitHub integration.
* **Creator Tier (â‰¥ 500,000 $KODEV)**: Unlocks advanced tools, on-chain deployment, and access to the prompt marketplace.
* **Innovator Tier (â‰¥ 1,500,000 $KODEV)**: Full access to all features, early beta tools, and community influence.

## ðŸ’¡ Stake or Hold

Users can either hold $KODEV in their connected wallet or stake it in the platform to maintain tier access.

## ðŸŽ¯ Aligned Incentives

This model rewards commitment and supports long-term product growth:

* Reduces reliance on centralized payments
* Encourages community ownership and participation
* Incentivizes holding and platform adoption

KodevAI's token-gated system transforms access into a form of ownershipâ€”empowering users to invest in their own creative future.
