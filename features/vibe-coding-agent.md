# Vibe Coding Agent

KodevAI’s core engine is the **Vibe Coding Agent** — a next-generation AI agent that understands your intent and builds real software from natural language prompts.

***

## 🎨 What Is the Vibe Coding Agent?

The Vibe Coding Agent is a multi-modal AI-powered assistant that:

* Interprets natural language project descriptions
* Designs UI layouts and generates code dynamically
* Manages backend, database, auth, and integrations
* Builds production-ready web apps and dApps

***

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. **Prompt Input** – You describe your app idea in plain English.
2. **Contextual Understanding** – The agent infers user intent, selects relevant templates, and maps dependencies.
3. **Code Generation** – It generates clean, modular frontend/backend code (React, Tailwind, Supabase, Solidity, etc.).
4. **Preview & Feedback** – Instantly preview your app and refine iteratively.

## 🔄 Continuous Refinement

The agent supports iterative feedback:

* 🤏 Add new features on the fly
* 🧩 Update data models
* 🎨 Tweak UI components

You stay in control while the agent handles the heavy lifting.

## 💼 Use Cases

* **Founders**: Rapid MVPs
* **Agencies**: Client mockups
* **Educators**: Teaching prototyping
* **Builders**: Onchain utilities

## 🔒 Powered by Tokens

Access to the Vibe Coding Agent is governed by the $KODEV tier model. The more tokens you hold, the more power the agent unleashes.
