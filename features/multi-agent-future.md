# 🤖 Multi-Agent Future

KodevAI isn't just one agent — it's the beginning of an entire ecosystem of collaborative AI agents.

### 🌐 Specialized Intelligence for Every Task

KodevAI will evolve into a network of purpose-built agents that specialize in different areas of app development:

* UI/UX Agent for interface design and layout
* Smart Contract Agent for Solidity logic and audit suggestions
* Backend Agent for APIs and database models
* DevOps Agent for CI/CD, GitHub flows, and on-chain deployments

### 🤝 Collaboration Between Agents

These agents will work in sync, passing context and actions across modules like a team:

* Agents communicate securely in your app session
* Maintain shared context of your app’s architecture
* Provide modular, testable code across stacks

### 🧠 Self-Learning & Evolving

Agents learn from:

* Community-rated prompts
* Token-gated feedback loops
* Developer corrections and fine-tuning

This decentralized, collaborative approach is the future of full-stack development — built right into KodevAI.

**Coming soon — as part of our roadmap evolution.**
