# Prompt-Based UI

KodevAI makes app and dApp building as simple as having a conversation. Its intuitive, chat-first interface eliminates the need for traditional no-code interfaces or complex dev environments.

## Key Capabilities

* **Conversational Input**\
  Describe your project or feature in natural language. No need to worry about technical syntax.
* **Real-Time Feedback**\
  The interface provides intelligent suggestions and live feedback to refine your prompts and outputs.
* **Persistent Context**\
  KodevAI retains project context across sessions, so you can build iteratively without starting over.
* **Multi-Turn Prompting**\
  Ask follow-ups, make adjustments, or switch features mid-conversation — KodevAI adapts fluidly.

## Why It Matters

Most builders get stuck between having an idea and executing it. KodevAI bridges that gap by turning prompts into production-ready code instantly. With no learning curve, even non-technical users can build full-stack apps with confidence.

Prompt, vibe, and ship — all from one clean interface.
