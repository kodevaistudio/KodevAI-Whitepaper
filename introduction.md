# Introduction

KodevAI is pioneering a new frontier in software development — a full-stack app/dApp builder that replaces traditional coding with pure prompt power. No more hiring dev teams, dragging blocks, or wrestling with configs. Just describe your idea, and KodevAI brings it to life.

We’ve combined cutting-edge LLM (Large Language Model) intelligence with Web3 technologies to create a frictionless building experience. At its core is a Vibe Coding Agent — an AI that understands your intent, codes intelligently, and iterates with you in real-time.

And here's the twist — instead of paying for monthly plans, you unlock features by holding or staking our native token, **$KODEV**. It’s not just a tool; it’s an ecosystem that rewards builders, prompters, and communities.

Let’s dive in.
