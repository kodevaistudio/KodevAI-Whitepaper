# Token Access Model

KodevAI uses a $KODEV token-based access model to unlock features and incentivize community contribution. Your token balance determines what capabilities you can access — ensuring a fair, decentralized usage model.

## 🎯 Access Tiers

Your $KODEV holdings grant you access to different functionality levels:

| Tier      | Holding Requirement | Access Level                                      |
| --------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Free      | < 90,000 $KODEV     | Basic features, preview-only builds               |
| Builder   | ≥ 90,000 $KODEV     | Full builds, GitHub push, 1-click deploy          |
| Creator   | ≥ 500,000 $KODEV    | Prompt marketplace access, custom workflows       |
| Innovator | ≥ 1,500,000 $KODEV  | Early features, agent training, DAO voting rights |

## 🧠 Why This Model?

* **No subscriptions**\
  Access is unlocked based on token holdings — you own your access.
* **Aligned incentives**\
  Users who contribute (via prompt creation, testing, etc.) are rewarded in $KODEV.
* **Decentralized governance (coming soon)**\
  Innovator-tier users will participate in governance over roadmap, feature prioritization, and more.

## 🔄 Dynamic Access

Your tier upgrades instantly as your wallet balance changes. Simply connect your Web3 wallet — no manual steps required.

## 🛠 How It Works

* Connect your wallet → we verify balance via smart contract.
* Based on your holdings, access is dynamically unlocked.
* Stake or hold tokens — both methods qualify.
