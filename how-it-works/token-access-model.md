# 🔐 Token Access Model

KodevAI uses a $KODEV token-based access model to unlock features and incentivize community contribution. Your token balance determines what capabilities you can access — ensuring a fair, decentralized usage model.

## 🎯 Access Tiers

Your $KODEV holdings grant you access to different functionality levels:

| Tier        | Holding Requirement     | Access Level                          |
|-------------|-------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Free        | < 90,000 $KODEV         | Basic features, preview-only builds    |
| Builder     | ≥ 90,000 $KODEV         | Full builds, GitHub push, 1-click deploy |
| Creator     | ≥ 500,000 $KODEV        | Prompt marketplace access, custom workflows |
| Innovator   | ≥ 1,500,000 $KODEV      | Early features, agent training, DAO voting rights |

## 🧠 Why This Model?

- **No subscriptions**  
  Access is unlocked based on token holdings — you own your access.

- **Aligned incentives**  
  Users who contribute (via prompt creation, testing, etc.) are rewarded in $KODEV.

- **Decentralized governance (coming soon)**  
  Innovator-tier users will participate in governance over roadmap, feature prioritization, and more.

## 🔄 Dynamic Access

Your tier upgrades instantly as your wallet balance changes. Simply connect your Web3 wallet — no manual steps required.

## 🛠 How It Works

- Connect your wallet → we verify balance via smart contract.
- Based on your holdings, access is dynamically unlocked.
- Stake or hold tokens — both methods qualify.
