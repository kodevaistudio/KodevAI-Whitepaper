# 🔁 Prompt. Vibe. Deploy. — How KodevAI Works

KodevAI revolutionizes app/dApp development by turning simple prompts into deployable products. Here's the streamlined workflow that powers the magic:

---

## 🧠 Step 1: Describe Your Idea

Kickstart your journey by chatting with Agent KodevAI. Just describe your concept in plain language — whether it's a Web3 dApp, SaaS tool, or personal portfolio. No coding, no technical docs.

> Example: "Build a crowdfunding dApp where users can raise BNB for creative projects."

## ✨ Step 2: Vibe Code in Action

KodevAI’s Vibe Coding Agent understands your idea and generates a full-stack codebase:

* Frontend UI (React/Tailwind)
* Backend logic (Node/Express, APIs)
* Smart contracts (Solidity)
* Web3 integration (wallet connect, token gating, etc.)

All code is clean, modular, and maintainable.

## 🧪 Step 3: Preview & Refine

See your app in action instantly:

* Live preview environment
* Refine via prompt feedback
* Access previous versions

Every change updates your codebase in real time.

## 🚀 Step 4: Deploy On-Chain or Web

With a single click, you can:

* Push to GitHub
* Deploy frontend to Netlify or Vercel
