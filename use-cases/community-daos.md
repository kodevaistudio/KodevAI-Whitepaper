## Collaborative Innovation, Fueled by AI

KodevAI offers DAOs a powerful toolkit for building internal apps, community tools, and public-facing platforms — all with zero-code overhead and full decentralization support.

### ✅ Why DAOs Love KodevAI

* **Decentralized App Building**\
  Empower DAO members to build without relying on centralized developers or agencies.

  Launch tools directly to BNB Chain to align with your community’s governance model.
* **Permissionless Prompt Marketplace**\
  Members can share prompts, earn $KODEV, and co-create solutions.
* **Token-Gated Tools**\
  Gate features, dashboards, or apps by token tiers — ideal for member-specific utilities.
* **Faster Consensus**\
  Build tools that support DAO proposals, voting, treasury, and community management — in hours, not weeks.
